console.log("null and undefined");

//null
// null has only one value "null"
// it doesnt belong to any of the type described above

let age = null;
// age = 20;
console.log(typeof age);

//note: null is  just a special value which represent nothing or empty or simply value unknown

// undefined: a variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined

let x;

console.log(x);

//technically its possible to assigned an undefined value to any variable but its not recommended

let a = undefined;

console.log(a);

// difference between undeefined and null

// undefined means a variable has been decleared but not yet assigned a value

// null is an assignement value it can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value

//note: javascript never set a value to null, you must do that urself
