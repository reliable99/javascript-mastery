// In the upcoming 3 video section we're going to cover some tricky concepts in JavaScript. Scope, Hoisting and Closures.

// First we're going to talk about the concept of Scope, a fundamental topic for any programming language. Then we're going to mention the concepts of hoisting and closures.

// I would dare to say that they are not all that useful in everyday coding. You're going to see what I mean in upcoming videos. If you sticked to the good programming habits, you would never even encounter the use of hoisting.

// I've still decided to include the so called "tricky concepts" because questions regarding closures and hoisting are often asked in interview questions. I've got you covered! ;)
