console.log("operator intro");

// We know many operators from school. They are things like addition +, multiplication *, subtraction -, and so on.

//In this chapter, weâ€™ll concentrate on aspects of operators that are not covered in school.

//As all other programming languages, JavaScript includes operators as well. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces a result which is 3 in this case.

//JavaScript includes following categories of operators.

//Arithmetic OperatorsComparison Operators
//Logical Operators
//Assignment Operators
//Conditional Operators
//In the next few videos, we're going to explore all of these operators in detail
